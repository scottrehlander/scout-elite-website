Head over to [LiveBarn](https://www.livebarn.com/) and find the first video of the game that you’d like to upload. Using your Premium LiveBarn subscription, you can download full 30 minute video clips directly from the website. Click the download button in the upper right corner of the LiveBarn video page. This will initiate a download of the video to your computer. Use the dropdown to navigate to the next video and repeat the process until you’ve downloaded all of the video segments that make up your full game.

**Important Note:**

Sometimes LiveBarn cuts up the 30 minute video chunks into smaller segments. It is important that you check the duration of each video before you download. If the end of the current video does not reach the full duration of the 30 minute window that was selected in LiveBarn, you will need to jump to the end of that video and let it play until the next segment starts. Once the next segment starts you can download the segment just as you had above.
