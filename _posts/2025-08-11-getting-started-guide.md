Our mission is to improve player development, easily and efficiently. Wherever you are on your path as a player, parent, or coach, I thank you for joining us and I’m grateful that we can be a small part of your journey for improvement. Let’s get started.

## What is included in the Scout Elite app suite?

### Scout Elite Xpress
A web-based video review and annotation tool.

In Scout Elite Xpress, you can upload your game videos and tag them with custom notes at specific time points. Annotations are added as “Clips” to a game video. Use the Game Video review session page to perform in-depth analysis with your coaches, team, or group of players for a single game. If you’d like to organize clips across games for a specific area of focus, you can add them into named clip collections and use them to optimize the time it takes to complete a review session.

### Scout Elite Live

Scout Elite Live is a mobile application for both iOS and Android that allows coaches, parents, or fans to track games in real time. You can add custom notes and track events such as shots, goals, penalties, turnovers, and more.

A mobile-friendly in-depth analysis section provides insights into how the game develops over time. You can use these insights to drive in-game decisions and make real time corrections.  Track all of your game events, the time they occurred, and notes to use with your video analysis later.  

Set up rosters and lines to make the selection of players for events fast and simple.  Scout Elite Live was made to be used by both coaches on the bench and parents in the stands.

## The Power of Two
You can use both apps independently, but when combining Live and Xpress, you no longer need to review your games to annotate the events. Publish your game from Scout Elite Live to Scout Elite Xpress then upload your game video and the magic happens. Your game videos will be annotated automatically, saving valuable time and effort while providing unparalleled insight to all of the users in your organization.
