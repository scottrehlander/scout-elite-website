As a youth hockey coach, I use Scout Elite Live to make my job easier and help my players learn. Here’s what the app can do right now, and what’s coming next.

## What Scout Elite Live Does Today

- **Live Game Event Clipping:** Track goals, penalties, and custom notes during games, right from your phone.
- **Instant Game Trends:** See stats and trends as the game happens, so you can make adjustments on the fly.
- **Automatic Video Review:** After the game, import your live-tagged events into video sessions. The app automatically creates clips, so you don’t have to scrub through hours of footage.
- **General Review:** Use your clips to communicate and engage with your your team.
- **Collaboration:** Share game videos with other coaches to help collaborate and find the most effective areas of improvement. Everyone stays in the loop.

## What’s Coming Next

The next big feature is a new "Review" session type. Soon, you’ll be able to:

- Organize clips into sessions for specific groups (e.g., "Defense Review," "Offense Review," "Goalie Review").
- Take a full game, clip it, and then add select clips to different review sessions for different groups.
- Keep sessions short, focused, and relevant for every player.

That’s the current state and the roadmap. If you’re using Scout Elite Live, I hope this helps you get the most out of it—and I’m excited for what’s coming next!
