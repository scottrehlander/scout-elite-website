We’re excited to announce a brand new feature in Scout Elite - **Review Sessions**.  

Review Sessions are organized sets of clips that you can share directly with your team. They give you the flexibility to use them as another tool for coaching in person or to send them out for athletes and parents to review on their own time.  

## Organize your Clips
Clips often pile up across multiple games and practices. With Review Sessions you can now pull clips together from **multiple clipping sessions** and they’ll be **automatically categorized by tag**. This makes it incredibly simple to show players the patterns that matter most without wasting time hunting for the right moments.  

### A practical example
Imagine you’ve been working on **defensive zone exits** over the past few weeks. You’ve tagged clips from three different games where the team struggled or succeeded with clean breakouts. With Review Sessions you can pull those clips into a single session, where they’re automatically grouped under the “Breakout” tag.  

Now, when you sit down with your team, you can walk through the successful clips to reinforce what’s working and then review the challenges so everyone understands what needs to improve. Even better, you can send the Review Session directly to players and parents so they can watch and learn on their own time.  

For parents, this can truly be a game-changer. It means they can be more involved in their child's development, even if their schedules are busy or they can't attend every practice or game. Parents get a window into what their child is learning, the feedback they're receiving, and the specific skills or moments being highlighted by coaches. This transparency helps parents support their athlete more effectively at home, reinforce key lessons, and celebrate progress together. It also fosters better communication between families and coaches, making everyone feel more connected to the team's goals and growth. Ultimately, giving parents access to Review Sessions empowers them to be active partners in their child's hockey journey, building confidence and understanding for both athlete and family.

Review Sessions are about making video analysis more accessible, more organized, and more impactful for every team. We can’t wait to see how you use them to teach, learn, and grow the game.
