## Coaches

**You’ve got the video. You’ve got the experience. But there are just not enough hours in the day.**

I totally get it, long game videos take forever to rewatch and clip. Important moments get missed. Video files of all of those clips you wanted to show the team get lost to time.

Scout Elite will change that for you.

### With Scout Elite You Can...
- Upload your clips in seconds - keeping them in a centralized place for review later
- Clip collaboratively – anyone can track the game's moments on their own devices and share them with you later
- Gone are the days of scrubbing through hours of game videos. Scout Elite makes this completely unnecessary.
- Organize teaching moments into targeted review sessions by player, position, or strategy  
- Share review sessions that both players and parents can rewatch on their own time
- Easily reference past sessions and use them to show progress or reinforce lessons past

### How to Use Scout Elite to Clip Game Video
1. Effortlessly clip the game live on a mobile device with **Scout Elite Live**  
2. Obtain and upload the full game video  
3. Publish clips from your mobile device(s)
4. Review, annotate, and refine the clips

### The Sharing Process

5. Share with players or parents for follow-up
