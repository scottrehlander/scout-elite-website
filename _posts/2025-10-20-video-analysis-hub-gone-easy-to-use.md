## Scout Elite Update: Cliping Sessions & Reviews

Things are moving quickly here at **Scout Elite**! Based on your feedback, we've made some changes to help you save time and get the most out of your video analysis experience.

### What's New?

**Clip Sessions** and **Reviews** are now separated from the old "Analysis Hub."  
This means:

- **Clearer Navigation:** You can now find your Clip Sessions and Reviews in dedicated views, making it easier to jump right into what matters most.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** No more hunting around for your clips. Everything is organized and accessible in just a few clicks.
- **Faster Access:** Whether you're a coach, parent, or athlete, you can get to your video analysis tools without extra steps or confusion.

### Why Did We Change?

We listened to your feedback!  
You told us you wanted:

- **Less clutter**
- **Simpler navigation**
- **A more intuitive experience**
- **Better tools for finding clips**

Our mission is to save coaches and parents as much time as possible. Making Scout Elite easy to use and understand is a core value for us.

### What’s Next?

We’re committed to continuous improvement. If you have suggestions or run into any issues, let us know! Your feedback drives every update.
